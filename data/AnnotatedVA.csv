"Diagnosis:  Advanced keratoconus both eyes  Outcome: Listed for penetrating keratoplasty right eye with a provisional date of 3rd July at St George's hospital in Tooting.  Scleral contact lens fitting for the left eye  Many thanks for referring this 21yo woman with advanced keratoconus.  She had an episode of hydrops in September 2013 in the right eye, and her vision is now HM in the right eye, 1/60 in the left.  She tells me that she had good unaided vision up until about the age of 12.  Rehabilitation of vision in the right eye would involve a corneal graft, and in view of her previous hyrops, this would be a penetrating keratoplasty.  The left cornea is unscarred, and it may be that visual rehabilitation may be achieved with a scleral contact lens, although I understand previous attempts have failed.  I have nonetheless booked her in to see if we can fit scleral contact lens here.    I note that she has asthma and mild atopic conjunctivits today, but is otherwise well, and takes no regular systemic medication.    She enquired about sight registration, and she is eligible for this, although it may well be in her interests to be registered more locally to her home.  I have suggested she take this letter to see if she can achieve this locally.

She feels her vision has remained the same since having her Ozurdex injection.  On examination, both anterior segments were unremarkable. There was a subcapsular cataract in the right eye. On fundoscopy, there were collateral vessels on the disc in the right eye. The left eye was unremarkable. An OCT scan showed minimal intraretinal fluid in the right eye.   I have explained to Mrs ####### her eyes appear stable. I have explained that it is likely she will need further Ozurdex treatment in the summer time. However, at this moment due to minimal amount of macula oedema in her right eye this would be a good time to consider cataract surgery.

"Diagnosis Intermittent left/alternating exotropia  Comment Freddie's family have noticed that his left eye wanders when he is tired.  There is no significant family history; his parents are not short-sighted.  On examination Freddie has very good unaided visual acuity of 0.00 logMAR in both eyes. On cover test he has a latent divergent strabismus (exophoria) when looking at a distance target; with near fixation there is a small intermittent left/alternating divergent squint (exotropia). His stereovision is reduced to 600 seconds of arc; Freddie found the test a bit tricky and this may be a performance issue and get better with repeated testing. Cycloplegic refraction shows Right -0.50/+0.50 x 90, Left -1.00/+0.50 x 90. This is very close to no prescription at all, and as his visual acuity is very good and his control over the squint is very good, Freddie does not need glasses at the moment. On fundoscopy, the optic nerve head and macula are healthy in both eyes.  In summary, Freddie has intermittent exotropia with good control, as his parents only notice it when he is tired. Freddie may become short-sighted in the future, and may benefit for glasses to see the whiteboard at school.  He does not need any treatment for exotropia at the moment. Future visits will continue to monitor his visual acuity, stereovision and controlled binocular acuity as a measure of squint control. Should treatment ever be required, glasses for shortsightedness can improve control. Surgery is a possibility, though the long-term benefits are unclear and often more surgery becomes necessary years after the first procedure.

"This 4 year old girl attended the clinic for a follow up visit after attending A&E on 29/6/2013. Her left eye surface is very inflamed. This is likely to be a reactivation of a herpes simplex virus infection; in addition, Anneliese has chronic lid margin inflammation (blepharitis), which makes her eye surface very vulnerable. Today her visual acuity in the left eye is reduced to 6/24; visual acuity in the right eye is 6/7.6. There is a dense opacity in the left central cornea, extending upwards. The epithelium is intact.  The best treatment for herpes simplex is an eye ointment, which is specific for use on the eye. I understand Anneliese's family have so far not used the ointment, because they fear it is too strong for the eye. Anneliese would benefit from this treatment, and it does not have any side-effects. Because the eye is so inflamed and the epithelium is intact, I have also prescribed a mild anti-inflammatory eye drop. This MUST only be used when also using aciclovir.

Even though biometry suggested a + 50D IOL be used, I decided to use our strongest ""stock"" IOL (+40.0 D SA60AT), on the basis that biometry in patients with angle-closure is very inaccurate, and there is a tendence for a significant myopic overshoot if biometric formulae are followed. For my records, I'd be very interested to know his final refractive outcome.   His anterior chamber is formed, with no iridocorneal contact. I suggest he stays on atropine at a minimum of twice a day for 6 weeks. I have warned him about the symptoms of aqueous misdirection (blurring +/- pain). If this does happen, options include laser zonulotomy/hyaloidotomy through the surgical iridectomy and/or inferior sectoral diode laser cycloablation (treating with 5-6 shots).

I reviewed Mrs ######### today in my Vitreoretinal Clinic.  She was referred to me for a second opinion following two macular hole operations in her right eye.  More recently she has had cataract surgery without lens implantation.    On examination today her visual acuity was 6/60 in the right and 6/6 in the left eye.  She is aphakic in the right eye.  Otherwise anterior segment examination was unremarkable.  Fundal examination revealed a large macular hole in the right eye which was confirmed today on OCT.  In the left eye there was no abnormality.    I explained to Mrs ######### today that the visual prognosis for the right eye was very poor given her  two failed macular hole procedures.  I have explained to her that this may sometimes be the case following macular hole surgery and that full closure cannot always be guaranteed.  I did however offer her the chance for a further procedure with silicone oil to see whether or not we could achieve macular hole closure.  I have however stressed that the visual acuity following this may continue to be poor or the surgery itself may fail.  She is willing to accept this risk and we plan to perform the operation in February under local anaesthetic.,200,"[{""start"": 277, ""end"": 281, ""text"": ""6/60"", ""labels"": [""VA""]}, {""start"": 289, ""end"": 294, ""text"": ""right"", ""labels"": [""Laterality""]}, {""start"": 299, ""end"": 302, ""text"": ""6/6"", ""labels"": [""VA""]}, {""start"": 310, ""end"": 314, ""text"": ""left"", ""labels"": [""Laterality""]}]",1,241,2022-05-26T22:31:28.232388Z,2022-05-26T22:31:28.232457Z,55.323
