She had an episode of hydrops in September 2013 in the right eye, and her vision is now HM in the right eye, 1\/60 in the left.  She tells me that she had good unaided vision up until about the age of 12.  Rehabilitation of vision in the right eye would involve a corneal graft, and in view of her previous hyrops, this would be a penetrating keratoplasty.  The left cornea is unscarred, and it may be that visual rehabilitation may be achieved with a scleral contact lens, although I understand previous attempts have failed.  I have nonetheless booked her in to see if we can fit scleral contact lens here.    I note that she has asthma and mild atopic conjunctivits today, but is otherwise well, and takes no regular systemic medication.    She enquired about sight registration, and she is eligible for this, although it may well be in her interests to be registered more locally to her home.  I have suggested she take this letter to see if she can achieve this locally.  We hope that eventually we may be able to get her to the situation where she no longer requires registration, but she may need assistance in the interim."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-05-26T00:49:18.725768Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T06:13:30.215027Z","project":4},{"id":891,"annotations":[{"id":935,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":208,"end":213,"text":"left","labels":["Laterality"]},"id":"hLdhGzI_KJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":194,"end":199,"text":"right","labels":["Laterality"]},"id":"Mpprf3dRjc","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":190,"end":193,"text":"6\/6","labels":["VA"]},"id":"KweFUp9phQ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":204,"end":207,"text":"6\/9","labels":["VA"]},"id":"KeO4SiEL20","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-05-27T06:12:58.935132Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T06:12:58.935202Z","lead_time":19.499,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":891,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"6ec0f33b-VAnotes.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"This 78 year old man was reviewed in the Cataract Service today following Right Phakoemulsification and IOL.

There is no significant family history; his parents are not short-sighted.  On examination Freddie has very good unaided visual acuity of 0.00 logMAR in both eyes. On cover test he has a latent divergent strabismus (exophoria) when looking at a distance target; with near fixation there is a small intermittent left\/alternating divergent squint (exotropia). His stereovision is reduced to 600 seconds of arc; Freddie found the test a bit tricky and this may be a performance issue and get better with repeated testing. Cycloplegic refraction shows Right -0.50\/+0.50 x 90, Left -1.00\/+0.50 x 90. This is very close to no prescription at all, and as his visual acuity is very good and his control over the squint is very good, Freddie does not need glasses at the moment. On fundoscopy, the optic nerve head and macula are healthy in both eyes.  In summary, Freddie has intermittent exotropia with good control, as his parents only notice it when he is tired. Freddie may become short-sighted in the future, and may benefit for glasses to see the whiteboard at school.  He does not need any treatment for exotropia at the moment. Future visits will continue to monitor his visual acuity, stereovision and controlled binocular acuity as a measure of squint control. Should treatment ever be required, glasses for shortsightedness can improve control. Surgery is a possibility, though the long-term benefits are unclear and often more surgery becomes necessary years after the first procedure.  I have discharged Freddie from follow-up."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-05-26T00:49:18.666742Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T03:42:33.356030Z","project":4},{"id":618,"annotations":[{"id":661,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":55,"end":58,"text":"VAR","labels":["Laterality"]},"id":"e4WAtABhJF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":66,"end":68,"text":"UA","labels":["Vision"]},"id":"nt3SSZptuH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":77,"end":80,"text":"VAL","labels":["Laterality"]},"id":"UWtPLvTtKN","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":59,"end":65,"text":"6\/36+1","labels":["VA"]},"id":"_lO71b-Kzf","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":69,"end":73,"text":"6\/12","labels":["Pinhole"]},"id":"zZt3xxLBFd","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":81,"end":87,"text":"6\/12-2","labels":["VA"]},"id":"bUsMRg4wuv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":88,"end":90,"text":"UA","labels":["Vision"]},"id":"mh2Mn79N8T","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":91,"end":95,"text":"6\/12","labels":["Pinhole"]},"id":"CYFo2WWVbk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-05-27T03:41:57.630598Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T03:41:57.630664Z","lead_time":70.262,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":618,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"6ec0f33b-VAnotes.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Diagnosis: Bilateral cortical cataracts (Right>>Left)  VAR 6\/36+1 UA 6\/12 PH VAL 6\/12-2 UA 6\/12 PH  Summary: The gentleman gives a 4-5 year insidious history of bilateral blurred vision (right>left).

The peripheral iridectomy was clear but I suspect there is narrowing now that the pilocarpine has been stopped. Mr ##### is aware of a deterioration in his vision and after a long discussion, he has now been listed for a right cataract procedure. The cataract surgery will benefit him in more than one way; it will improve his vision, as there is no other pathology affecting his vision present in the eye and also, the angle will be opened preventing an acute angle closure attack.

Examination revealed a left total retinal detachment with evidence of grade C PVR scarring of the retina. No break was identified however there was a full thickness macular hole noted. The gentleman will require complex detachment surgery and we have informed him of the risks and benefits as well as the very gaurded prognosis given the nature of the detachment. The surgrey will require the use of silicone oil which while in situ will leave him with reduced vision and he has been made aware that there is the real possibility of the oil being left in the eye long term. We have also explained that although the prognosis is very gaurded, if he opted for no intervention then this will result in the complete loss of sight in the left eye. He is keen to proceed and so we have listed him for surgery for Tuesday 15\/01\/13.  Examination also revealed a left lower lid BCC and we would be grateful if you could arrange for him to have this treated locally in Gibraltar."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-05-26T00:49:18.566478Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T02:24:04.718472Z","project":4},{"id":113,"annotations":[{"id":154,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":144,"end":147,"text":"6\/9","labels":["VA"]},"id":"ct80gJb00b","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-05-26T02:21:34.083560Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T02:21:34.083770Z","lead_time":50.538,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":113,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"6ec0f33b-VAnotes.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"This patient was reviewed in clinic and the current situation is summarised below :-  Diagonsis:  Post right cataract surgery   Visual acuity : 6\/9  Plan  This patient has been listed for left phakoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation under local anaesthetic as a day case at Mile End on the 20 February 2013."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-05-26T00:49:18.566348Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T02:21:34.159225Z","project":4},{"id":112,"annotations":[{"id":153,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":true,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-05-26T02:20:43.102766Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T02:20:43.102830Z","lead_time":9.899,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":112,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"6ec0f33b-VAnotes.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"This 72 year old woman attended the clinic for a routine follow up visit.
