After a discussion of the benefits and risks of surgery she elected to proceed with surgery and has been listed for: Right cataract surgery under LA although they are going to confirm. Due to the high myopia she would be very anisometropic post surgery and therefore it be worth performing left catarct surgery shortly afterwoods.
This 79 year old woman attended the clinic for a routine follow up visit.   Her principal diagnosis is Left aphakia, and right cataract. The eye has now settled, with a refracted best vision of 6/12 achievable in the left. Vision is 6/18 ph 6/9 right. I discussed refractive options with her today that included: contact lens wear, scleral haptic-fixated lens implantation, or Artisan iris-clip lens implantation. After consideration, the patient has opted for a secondary Artisan lens implant. Once the equipment booking arrangements are in place, I will provide a date for her surgery.

Diagnosis: Severe Diabetic Retinopathy Blind Left Eye Right Fibrovascular Traction and Preretinal/Vitreous Haemorrahge Dense Right Cataract  Unaided Vision: RE 1/60 LE NPL  Outcome: Listed for Right Cataract Surgery   This pleasant gentleman attended clinic after a recent drop in his vision in his only right eye. Examination revealed a dense right cataract and right fibrovascular retinal traction and haemorrahge. We discussed various management options including the implications of not intervening, the risks involved in a delamination procedure as well as a catract operation given this is his only eye. After discussion it was felt best to proceed with the right cataract in the first instance and review with the situation, with a delamination more than likley in the future to prevent further visual loss. As such we have listed Mr ####### for the procedure above on the 18th Jan 2013 and shall of course keep you informed of his progress.
Diagnosis: Left lower lid post operative granuloma.  2.  Left lateral lower lid laxity.   I reviewed this pleasant 25 year old gentleman who was assaulted in August, 2012 in Portugal whilst on holiday and sustained a left orbital floor fracture which was repaired by the local maxfax team with a titanium mesh.  He unfortunately developed a wound site granuloma roughly ten days after the removal of sutures back in the UK which has been weeping and discharging causing the patient significant discomfort.    On examination there was a full range of ocular movements with normal colour vision and pupil responses and there appears to be a predunculated granuloma in the left lower lid measuring  10.1 x 7.5mm with no associated lagophthalmos and normal fundal examination.  Plan: In view of these findings we have put the patient on the waiting list for left lower lid tightening and excision of the granuloma on 21st December 2012.  He has been put on regular lubricants and Chloramphenicol ointment at night.   Kind regards.
Diagnosis Bilateral pterygium R>L Bilateral pseudophakia  This 68 year old man attended the clinic for a routine follow up visit. He continues to have blurred vision in the right eye.

Diagnosis: Right aphakic (managed with CL) Left cataract Mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy Early right aphakic bullous keratopathy Possible right aphakic glaucoma  Vision: RE 6/6 with CL, LE 6/12  This gentleman has early corneal decompensation in the right eye due to aphakia. AS he has normal vision with a contact lens, this requires no treatment at this stage. If it does progress to involve his central cornea, he may require a corneal transplant.  Mr ##### also has a left cataract, and after the discussion of risks and benefits, has been placed on the waiting list for left cataract surgery in February.  Finally, the intraocular pressure was also noted to be elevated in the right eye today; 29mmHg in the RE and 17mmHg in the LE. He appears to have some changes of glaucomatous optic nerve damage, but his requires review by the Glaucoma team at Moorfields. Could you kindly refer him to the Glaucoma Service for an appointment within 3 months?
NEW PATIENT  This patient was reviewed in clinic today and the current situation is summarised below:  Plan:  This patient has been listed for right phakoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation under local anaesthetic as a day case at Mile End on the 20 February 2013.

Diagnosis: 1 Left Pseudophakic Total PVR RD with a Full Thickness Macular Hole  2 Previous Left Cataract Extraction - Morocco 3 Left YAG Capsulotomy - Gibraltar 4 Right Cataract 5 Right AMD Changes 5 Left Lower Lid BCC   Aided Vision: RE 6/60 (6/36) LE HM    Outcome: Listed for Left RD Repair (Vitrectomy/Peel/ILM Peel/360 Laser/Oil - gaurded Prognosis 15/01/13 DC LA  Many thanks for referring this very pleasant gentleman who reports a 2 week history of reduced vision in his left eye. Examination revealed a left total retinal detachment with evidence of grade C PVR scarring of the retina. No break was identified however there was a full thickness macular hole noted. The gentleman will require complex detachment surgery and we have informed him of the risks and benefits as well as the very gaurded prognosis given the nature of the detachment. The surgrey will require the use of silicone oil which while in situ will leave him with reduced vision and he has been made aware that there is the real possibility of the oil being left in the eye long term. We have also explained that although the prognosis is very gaurded, if he opted for no intervention then this will result in the complete loss of sight in the left eye. He is keen to proceed and so we have listed him for surgery for Tuesday 15/01/13.  Examination also revealed a left lower lid BCC and we would be grateful if you could arrange for him to have this treated locally in Gibraltar.
I would be grateful if this patient ould be seen in your clinic.  Background: Bilateral Retinal peripapillar Colobomas              Bilateral Aphakia after congenital cataracts surgery in Russia as a baby              Nystagmus              Esotropia              Bilateral peripheral corneal oedema (Brown-McLean Syndrome)  She was referred to us for the corneal oedema.  We are planning stromal puncture in the left eye. IOPs today were 30 mmHg R and 21 mmHg L.  CD ratios were 0.4 right and 0.9 left.  She tells me that, as far as she is aware, IOPs have never been raised in the past.  I have prescribed g latanoprost od in the right eye and will ask her GP to continue prescribing this until she see you.
The above patient is booked to have a Left Retinal Detachment surgery (vitrectomy, peel, cryotherapy retinopexy, laser retinopexy, injection of silicone oil) under LA. He presented to the pre-operative asessment clinic with a blood pressure of 240/110 mmHg and pulse rate of 101/min. It was re-checked after 20 minutes and it went down to 190/100 mmHg.   The patient is not symptomatic except for occassional headaches and the only medication he takes are paracetamol. His /interpreter/friend attributes the high BP to nervousness and for fasting the whole morning for some reason.  He is adviced to see his GP as soon as he possibly can for some urgent blood pressure monitoring and treatment to prevent cancellation on day of operation.

This young patient has advanced keratoconus and has run into major problems with her visual acuity on account of the refractive consequences of this shape disorder of the cornea.  At present in the right eye, he has very poor spectacle corrected visual acuity and awaits a contact lens for better vision.  This lens was ordered more than 2 months ago and is still not available for wear causing major hold ups with his work at school.  The additional problem is that he has very poor visual potential at present in the left eye with scarring itself secondary to rupture of his membrane of the cornea.  Surgery to replace the cornea with a left transplant has been scheduled for 25th March and the visual rehabilitation following the surgery may well take several months.  We will try to arrange dispensing of the contact lenses as quickly as possible.  I would support Ssyful-Islam's request for special allowances to be made in regard to his examinations at school.  He has had major visual difficulties during the past school year and I would be happy to provide any further medical information that may be required by the school to support any request by his parents.

We have offered surgical correction of this squint. We have discussed the risks of over/undercorrection, the slight risk of loss of vision, a small risk of diplopia. Date of surgery has been offered for July for further detailed discussions/ consenting and remeasurements of her squint.  She will be seen about two weeks prior to surgery.
Diagnosis: BE cataract  I saw this gentleman in clinic today with a view to cataract surgery.  He did not wear his own specs for distance vision for the eye test and the uncorrected distance visual acuity was 6/24 bilaterally, improving to 6/9 with ph.  On the ocular examiantion he presented with bilateral cataracts and no significant fundus abnormalities.  We discussed the risks and benefit of surgery, we also discussed the alternative of not undergoing surgery and wear the required and appropriate distance glasses which should guarantee him a level of vision close to what achieved with the ph.  Mr #### haso also a significant corneal astigmatism, exceeding the 2 dioptres in both eyes, hence I warned him that he might require distance and reading glasses following surgery.  I also informed him of the characteristics of the multifocal and toric lenses, which are only available in private practice.  Mr #### was keen on proceeding with surgery to the left eye, with the implantation of a standard monofocal IOL. Accordingly, I have listyed him for surgery.
I reviewed Mrs ######### today in my Vitreoretinal Clinic.  She was referred to me for a second opinion following two macular hole operations in her right eye.  More recently she has had cataract surgery without lens implantation.    On examination today her visual acuity was 6/60 in the right and 6/6 in the left eye.  She is aphakic in the right eye.  Otherwise anterior segment examination was unremarkable.  Fundal examination revealed a large macular hole in the right eye which was confirmed today on OCT.  In the left eye there was no abnormality.    I explained to Mrs ######### today that the visual prognosis for the right eye was very poor given her  two failed macular hole procedures.  I have explained to her that this may sometimes be the case following macular hole surgery and that full closure cannot always be guaranteed.  I did however offer her the chance for a further procedure with silicone oil to see whether or not we could achieve macular hole closure.  I have however stressed that the visual acuity following this may continue to be poor or the surgery itself may fail.  She is willing to accept this risk and we plan to perform the operation in February under local anaesthetic.

She has had multiple EDTA chelations and PTKs.   We are considering an autokeratoplasty (switching the right and left corneas) in the future, and would like your opinion regarding the possibility and safety of removal of the silicone oil in order to reduce the risk of calcium build up in the corneal transplant.  A routine appointment in the VR clinic would be much appreciated.
This 64 year old man attended the clinic follow-up after cataract surgery in the left eye 5/2/2013. He feels his vision is improved but notes some floaters in the peripheral visual field.

This lady was referred to the Glaucoma Service via our colleagues in the Medical Retina Service where she is seen for diabetic retinopathy.  A concern was raised about optic disc asymmetry.    Ms Amin does indeed have some features suspicious for glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the right eye.  She also has significant posterior subcapsular cataract in both eyes.  In the first instance, I have recommended commencing IOP lowering treatment and also to put her on the waiting list for left cataract surgery.  She has agreed to this course of action.  I have therefore prescribed her G. Xalatan nocte to both eyes and I have put her on the waiting list for left phacoemulsification + insertion of intraocular lens to be undertaken as a local anaesthetic day case procedure.  She will receive a date for the surgery in due course and I have arranged to see her again in 3 months time.  I would be grateful if you would continue the Xalatan as a repeat prescription.
I was delighted to review Ms Kukurudza at the Adenxal clinic today.  Examination revealed bilateral Dermatochalasis and ptosis more on the left side.

There was no evidence of active neovascularization today. His RE is comfortable. His LE has chronic CSMO. He had laser treatment for this in the past with no evidence of benefit. He also had 3 IVTA injections in the past with some documented improvement adn no sign of steroid responsiveness. His old FFAs show evidence of ischaemia in his LE fovea , and this is a limiting factor in terms of the expected benefit from any of the potential interventions for his LE macular oedema. However the patient is one eyed at the moment and he feels that his vision in the LE is getting worse. Today he had gross macular oedema which rendered laser treatment difficult. After discussing the potential risks and benefits of the alternative treatment we decided to proceed with a IVTA LE.

This 90 year old woman came for a post -operative review today following left phacoemulsification surgery.She has not noted an improvement in vision however wants her right cataract done ASAP.  Her visual acuity was 6/18-2 (corrected in both eyes) and the intraocular presssure was normal. The left eye has settled nicely and posterior examination shows a large myopic stapyloma extending into the macula on the left however the right macula appears relatively healthy.  I have explained that her post-op vision is reduced due to the myopic macular degeneration. I have listed her for the right eye and hope that her vision improves once this is done.

This 51 year old man was discharged from hospital today.   - Diagnosis: nanophthalmos, primary angle-closure glaucoma  - Operation: right clear lens extraction with intraocular lens implantation, and surgical iridectomy  Comments Pre-op IOP was 38mmHg on diamox. Post op IOP is 22mmHg today off Diamox. His visual acuity unaided is 6/18+2. Even though biometry suggested a + 50D IOL be used, I decided to use our strongest "stock" IOL (+40.0 D SA60AT), on the basis that biometry in patients with angle-closure is very inaccurate, and there is a tendence for a significant myopic overshoot if biometric formulae are followed. For my records, I'd be very interested to know his final refractive outcome.   His anterior chamber is formed, with no iridocorneal contact. I suggest he stays on atropine at a minimum of twice a day for 6 weeks. I have warned him about the symptoms of aqueous misdirection (blurring +/- pain). If this does happen, options include laser zonulotomy/hyaloidotomy through the surgical iridectomy and/or inferior sectoral diode laser cycloablation (treating with 5-6 shots). I'd be happy to discuss, and see him again, if this happens, if you wish. However, things seem to be be going very smoothly at the moment.

This 4 year old girl attended the clinic for a follow up visit after attending A&E on 29/6/2013. Her left eye surface is very inflamed. This is likely to be a reactivation of a herpes simplex virus infection; in addition, Anneliese has chronic lid margin inflammation (blepharitis), which makes her eye surface very vulnerable. Today her visual acuity in the left eye is reduced to 6/24; visual acuity in the right eye is 6/7.6. There is a dense opacity in the left central cornea, extending upwards. The epithelium is intact.  The best treatment for herpes simplex is an eye ointment, which is specific for use on the eye. I understand Anneliese's family have so far not used the ointment, because they fear it is too strong for the eye. Anneliese would benefit from this treatment, and it does not have any side-effects. Because the eye is so inflamed and the epithelium is intact, I have also prescribed a mild anti-inflammatory eye drop. This MUST only be used when also using aciclovir.  For the blepharitis, I have recommended daily warm lid compresses and lid margin cleaning and have given Anneliese's father a leaflet to explain how to do these. We will review Anneliese in Mr ######## clinic next week.

Diagnosis: Hypermetropia  Comment:  Isabel wears glasses for hypermetropia, which slightly undercorrect her actual prescription. She does not have any problems with her vision, particular no difficulty seeing at night. Her visual acuity is perfect with her current glasses, at -0.100 logMAR in both eyes, and so is her 3D vision (stereopsis), at 55 seconds of arc. Her eyes are straight, there is esophoria only (a slight tendency for the eyes to drift inward, which is controlled with both eyes are open). On cycloplegic refraction, I found a hypermetropic prescription of Right +7.00/+0.50x90 and Left +7.50DS. The ocular media are clear, and optic nerve head, macula and retina are healthy in both eyes.  In view of her excellent vision and stereovision I would not recommend changing her glasses. She should have a test for glasses once a year. I have discharged her from follow-up.

Lumigan to both eyes nocte g. Dexamethasone 0.1 % to Left bd  RESTART: g. Pilocarpine 2% to Right bd  This lovely 80 year old man attended the Glaucoma clinic for a routine follow up visit today. His eye pressures remain stable. On examination today Mr ##### was found to have a very narrow angle present in the right eye. The peripheral iridectomy was clear but I suspect there is narrowing now that the pilocarpine has been stopped. Mr ##### is aware of a deterioration in his vision and after a long discussion, he has now been listed for a right cataract procedure. The cataract surgery will benefit him in more than one way; it will improve his vision, as there is no other pathology affecting his vision present in the eye and also, the angle will be opened preventing an acute angle closure attack. I have restarted Mr ##### on the pilocarpine and would be very grateful if you could please provide all of the above drops on repeat prescription until further notice. Mr ##### has also been started on lid hygiene treatment to reduce/stop the blepharitis. He will be seen again in the clinic in 6-8 weeks (just before his surgery).
Diagnosis:   Visual acuity: Right Eye: 6/18 Glasses Left Eye: 6/18 Glasses  No injection as stable.  He will be reviewed in 5 weeks or urgently if vision reduced or distorted.

He denies any visual problems but was sent by his optician for a YAG Capsulotomy. He himself has not noticed any new vision problems but does noticed a difference between his right and left eye.  On examination, both anterior segments were unremarkable. The right eye had an IOL in situ with a clear posterior capsule. The left eye had a nuclear sclerotic cataract. On fundoscopy, there were drusen at both macula, right>left.  I have explained to Mr. ###### that he has age related macula degernation, right>left.

I note he has previously had a normal FFA & OCT (Sutton Hospital). The OCT repeated today revealed no central IRF/SRF. There is a possibility of an area of right superior retinal thickening seen. However, this would not explain the visual history. The quality of the image was suboptimal secondary to the cortical cataracts.  Plan: Waiting list for right cataract extraction with IOL (22/04/2014) & Review OPD (01/05/2014)
Diagnosis Intermittent left/alternating exotropia  Comment Freddie's family have noticed that his left eye wanders when he is tired.  There is no significant family history; his parents are not short-sighted.  On examination Freddie has very good unaided visual acuity of 0.00 logMAR in both eyes. On cover test he has a latent divergent strabismus (exophoria) when looking at a distance target; with near fixation there is a small intermittent left/alternating divergent squint (exotropia). His stereovision is reduced to 600 seconds of arc; Freddie found the test a bit tricky and this may be a performance issue and get better with repeated testing. Cycloplegic refraction shows Right -0.50/+0.50 x 90, Left -1.00/+0.50 x 90. This is very close to no prescription at all, and as his visual acuity is very good and his control over the squint is very good, Freddie does not need glasses at the moment. On fundoscopy, the optic nerve head and macula are healthy in both eyes.  In summary, Freddie has intermittent exotropia with good control, as his parents only notice it when he is tired. Freddie may become short-sighted in the future, and may benefit for glasses to see the whiteboard at school.  He does not need any treatment for exotropia at the moment. Future visits will continue to monitor his visual acuity, stereovision and controlled binocular acuity as a measure of squint control. Should treatment ever be required, glasses for shortsightedness can improve control. Surgery is a possibility, though the long-term benefits are unclear and often more surgery becomes necessary years after the first procedure.  I have discharged Freddie from follow-up.

Diagnosis:  Right central serous retinopathy (CSR)  Right choroidal naevus  Recent diagnosis bony metastases - presumed prostate primary - under investigation Previous diagnosis prostate cancer - 2009 , 2013 - radiotherapy Previous lobectomy lung carcinoma 1999    Visual acuity: Right 6/60 pinhole 6/12 ; Left 6/12 pinhoe 6/6 Intraocular pressure normal both eyes  Retinal imaging studies today: OCT - persistent subretinal fluid Angiography - fluorescein and indocyanine green - no evidence of ocular metastases; right central serous retinopathy with similar origin of leak as in 2014 B scan ultrasound right eye - no evidence of mass lesion right eye; macular naevus flat  Comment; I reviewed Mr ####### in the medical retina service today. The right macular naevus remains stable. There is persistent right subretinal fluid. Mr ####### had undergone a previous course of intravitreal Lucentis treatment for a presumed occult subretinal neovascularisation secondary to age-related macular degeneration. This did not improve the subretinal fluid.  We have discussed the various treatment options for CSR (avoiding exogenous cortiosteroids; considering high endogenous steroids - Cushing's disease is rare in this type of presentation; photodynamic therapy - this therapy has not been funded by CCGs for the last 2 years for patients at Moorfields; oral eplerenone for a 3 months course - recent small case series published; focal argon laser to the source of leak).  We have opted for a focal argon laser treatment to the right eye, which was performed today. We will review him in clinic within 8 weeks. I would be very grateful for an update on his medical conditions and treatment plan as these become better formulated after his planned investigations. Many thanks.

Thank you very much for referring this 63 year old woman who I saw in Medical Retinal Service today.  Visual acuity: Right Eye: 6/18 Pinhole Left Eye: 6/12 Pinhole  Diagnosis: Bilateral hypertensive retinopathy Bilateral non proliferative diabetic retinopathy Bilateral visually significant cataracts  Blood pressure today 157/97 Randon blood sugar: 10.8 mmol/L  Mrs ######## has noted a gradual decline in her vision over the last year and a visit to her optician showed widespread retinal haemorrhages which prompted her referral here. She is a long standing history of poorly controlled  hypertension and diabetes, and recently has been diagnosed with impaired renal function secondary to above. She tells me that is now undergoing investigations to address the above.   From an ophthalmic perspective she has visually significant cataracts in both eyes and evidence of non proliferative diabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy. There is no macula odema or and retinal neovascualrisation that requires immediate treatment. However, she will need to be closely monitored. She will also benefit from cataract surgery, but this is best done in the context opf stable retinal disease. I have given her information on cataract surgery and I have suggested that she tries to optimise her blood sugar levels and blood pressure with yourself.   We will review her in 3 months and we can consider cataract surgery then if appropriate. I have also suggested a formal refraction with us in teh near future.
This gentleman has a lower pressure in his left eye now than previously documented (4mmHg) but his corrected acuities are: right 6/5-2 corrected and left 6/9 (stable) and there are no sequelae of hypotony in his left eye.  I have advised him of symptoms to look out given the low pressure.  He should also wear a shield at night and be careful not to rub his eye or do any heavy lifting.  His right eye looks to be settling down well after his cataract surgery 5 weeks ago. I have given hi another subconjuinctival injection of dexamethasone and lignocaine as his right bleb is looking a little inflamed.  He has no uveitis but he does have a small area of retained cortical lens matter in his right anterior chamber which happens very occasionally after cataract surgery, particularly in myopic patients.  We have planned to remove this under local anaesthetic in the new year but will see him again before, as if it is adsorbed spontaneously then we can cancel this operation.  In the interim his drops are:  g decxamethasone PF 6 x day RIGHT eye until review g chlorampheicol PF  QDS RIGHT eye 5 days

This lady is a referral from the cataract service.   Bilateral pseudophakia  This Arabic-speaking lady underwent a left cataract surgery which was uncomplicated on 4/4/2016. Pre-operative vision was 6/9. Prior to surgery the fundus was reported as normal in appearance. The day after surgery, she noted vision had deteriorated significantly. It has remained unchanged since then.  ON examination there is retrohyaloid collection of degenerating blood at the macula. Inferiorly, there is a large elevated lesion with subretinal material surrounded by pigment. Immediately nasal to the left large lesion, there is a hamorrhagic lesion. On  ICG, there was extensive blocking and no macular leaking vessels could be identified.  Fluoroscein angiogram showed there is active leakage from the small inferior haemorrhagic lesion c/w a CRNVM  We will obtain a spectralis OCT at City road through the lesions and USS B scan to ensure there is no part of the larger lesion where the appearance is consistent with a malignancy.  The primary differentials are active eccentric disciform  and polyploidal chorioretinopathy.  We will see her in 2 weeks

Referral for Glaucoma review  Mr ######## attended for a routine contact lens check for Keratoconus, he wears spectacles for the right eye VA = 6/5- and the left wears a rigid contact lens VA = 6/18. We have recently been monitoring his visual fields which are repeatably outside normal limits and he has some asymmetry of the disc cupping, R = 0.2, L = 0.55. His intraocular pressures are within normal limits (R = 12 mm Hg, L = 10 mm Hg by Goldmann tonometry at 4:40pm) but due to his Keratoconus these are unreliable due to his thin corneas (Pachymetry R = 529 um, L = 495 um).   Due to the repeatable field defect in both eyes, I would be very grateful if you would refer this 42 year old man to the Glaucoma service at Moorfields Eye Hospital for further assessment. We will continue to review him routinely in the contact lens clinic and see him in 6 months time.

This 42 year old woman attended the Accident and Emergency department, and was referred on to the clinic. She noted an inferior visual field loss on Sunday (3 days ago) which worsened to involve the central vision on Wednesday morning. When seen yesterday in casualty her vision was 6/36 and she had a macular off retinal detachment. She was asked to come in today (starved) as there is always a chance that we can undertake next day retinal detachment surgery as long as there are not too many other urgent cases. Today, she has an almost total detachment with vision of 1/60.   We have had to counsel her that she unfortunately has a low chance of getting a return of central vision, and that any surgery would be done primarily to retain what vision she has left in the right side.   She was offered surgery under local anaesthetic today but was understandably worried about keeping still for us, so would like general anaesthetic. She will be placed on the urgent list for right vitrectomy retinal detachment repair, to happen at some point over the next few days.   She will need to stay nil by mouth from midnight on the weekend days, and from 6am on weekdays, so that when we call her by 11am to come in she is able to have a general anaesthetic.

Diagnosis: Right Central Retinal Vein Occlusion with Macula Oedema 2012            Right Ozurdex Treatment            Left Pseudophakia  Visual Acuity: RE 6/60 - PH: 6/36-1, LE 6/9 - PH: 6/6  Comments: I reviewed this 75 year old lady in Mr. ######## clinic. She feels her vision has remained the same since having her Ozurdex injection.  On examination, both anterior segments were unremarkable. There was a subcapsular cataract in the right eye. On fundoscopy, there were collateral vessels on the disc in the right eye. The left eye was unremarkable. An OCT scan showed minimal intraretinal fluid in the right eye.   I have explained to Mrs ####### her eyes appear stable. I have explained that it is likely she will need further Ozurdex treatment in the summer time. However, at this moment due to minimal amount of macula oedema in her right eye this would be a good time to consider cataract surgery. Mrs. ####### agrees and she has been listed for her right cataract operation in April 2014.

Diagnosis:  Advanced keratoconus both eyes  Outcome: Listed for penetrating keratoplasty right eye with a provisional date of 3rd July at St George's hospital in Tooting.  Scleral contact lens fitting for the left eye  Many thanks for referring this 21yo woman with advanced keratoconus.  She had an episode of hydrops in September 2013 in the right eye, and her vision is now HM in the right eye, 1/60 in the left.  She tells me that she had good unaided vision up until about the age of 12.  Rehabilitation of vision in the right eye would involve a corneal graft, and in view of her previous hyrops, this would be a penetrating keratoplasty.  The left cornea is unscarred, and it may be that visual rehabilitation may be achieved with a scleral contact lens, although I understand previous attempts have failed.  I have nonetheless booked her in to see if we can fit scleral contact lens here.    I note that she has asthma and mild atopic conjunctivits today, but is otherwise well, and takes no regular systemic medication.    She enquired about sight registration, and she is eligible for this, although it may well be in her interests to be registered more locally to her home.  I have suggested she take this letter to see if she can achieve this locally.  We hope that eventually we may be able to get her to the situation where she no longer requires registration, but she may need assistance in the interim.

Thank you very much for referring this 79 year old man who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   He has visually significant cataract and should benefit from surgery.   His visual acuity was 6/9 right and 6/9 left.  After a discussion of the benefits and risks of surgery he elected to proceed with surgery and has been listed for:  right phakoemulsification and iol   We discussed the COMPLICATIONS, benefits, risks of cataract surgery and an information leaflet was given to the patient. We also discussed the option of conservative management, i.e. not doing surgery.  Benefits: good chance of improving the vision if successful Risks: 1 in 1000 of severe visual loss due to an infection and 1 in 100 of operative complications which may require another operation or limit the vision permanently. We will aim to correct distance vision after cataract surgery, however distance glasses are sometimes required after surgery to get the clearest possible vision. All patients will also require glasses for reading after surgery.    Following discussion of the risks and benefits we have listed the above patient for cataract surgery.
Many thanks for asking me to see this gentleman with his left non-epithelialising corneal graft. He therefore underwent a left sided lateral and central prolene suture tarsorrhaphy on silicone bolsters which I hope will protect the graft and allow it to become epithelialised. When he looks to the right the graft can still be examined, and if necessary the central tarsorrhaphy can be removed once his graft begins to epithelialise.  With kind regards,
She has been listed for left phakoemulsification and iol and will be admitted on 7 Aug 2014.   She has been prescribed Sodium hyaluronate 0.2% eye drops (No Preservative), 1 drop(s) prn Eye (Both) Until review Simple eye ointment, 1 strip nocte Eye (Both) Until review.

This 22 year old woman attended the clinic for a routine follow up visit.   Diagnosis: Decompensating exophoria.   Comment: Ms Haciepiri was reviewed in the Eye Clinic today. She has become increasingly aware of the divergent squint, particularly when she is tired or had alcohol to drink. Her symptoms mainly occur when she is looking at a computer screen for long periods of time and when she is at university while taking notes during classes. We discussed the pros and cons of surgery and have listed her for a right squint operation to bring the eyes back into their comfort zone where she will be able to control her squint better. We do not think she will tolerate an adjustable and probably wouldn't tolerate a toxin injection either.

Thank you very much for referring this 84 year old man who was reviewed in the Cataract Service today.   His visual acuity was 6/24 right and 6/12 left.  He has developed a posterior capsule opacification in his right eye which can be resolved with YAG laser capsulotomy. There is also a marked epiretinal membrane with retinal thickening.  He has visually significant cataract in his left eye and should benefit from surgery, but he would prefer to wait with the procedure until he is sure about his right eye prognosis.   He has been listed for right YAG capsulotomy and we will see him in the clinic a week after the procedure to perform a retinal OCT scan.  I have also referred him to our vitreoretinal service for evaluation of the epiretinal membrane.
Diagnosis  Keratoconus  Bilateral pseudophakia  Bilateral treated PDR   Mrs ######## keratoconus is stable.

I would be very grateful if you would see this 55 year old woman who gives a very clear history of sudden (over a period of a week) deterioration in vision in both eyes which has persisted.  She was referred to me as she does have early cataracts in both eyes, but these would not explain her level of acuity of 6/24 in each eye with improvement to only 6/18 with pinhole. She had a diagnostic refraction, which I couldn't find the record of, about 3 weeks ago and apparently this did not prove helpful.  In view of the incongruity of the history for presentation of cataracts and the disparity between cataract morphology and acuity, I would be grateful for your opinion.  I have given her an appointment for review with me in 6 months, but if you can find no other cause for her reduced vision, then I can see her sooner with a view to cataract surgery.

Thank you very much for referring this 88 year old man whom I saw in the clinic today.   Mr ##### has right bullous keratopathy, presumably secondary to complicated cataract surgery.  There is no evidence of corneal endothelial dystrophy.  Marked iris atrophy is present, which raises the possibility of herpetic corneal oedema, however the atrophy could be well explained by his past right angle closure glaucoma.   I have booked Mr ##### for endothelial keratoplasty on the 10th November.  3 weeks prior, I have asked him to commence a course of dexamethasone.  This will help us to confirm the oedema is not inflammatory in nature, as is the case with herpetic eye disease.   We will see him in November.

It was a pleasure to see Mrs ####### a nursing colleague in clinic today.  As you say, she has a very significant history of right sided epiphora.  Our assessment today indicates that this is due to nasolacrimal duct obstruction.  I have explained to her that she will require DCR lacrimal drainage surgery in order to improve her symptoms and she is keen to proceed.  We will arrange this for endonasal procedure to be booked under general anaesthesia in the near future.
Diagnosis: Normal tension glaucoma  Treatment: Ganfort mane both eyes; Azopt bd both eyes  Follow-up: Listed for right trabeculectomy + MMC, LA daycase  Mrs ####### pressures were right: 15 mmHg, left: 16 mmHg.  She had progression of her right visual field and after discussion with her and Miss Jones we have listed her for right trabeculectomy.  I have asked her to stop the alphagan and continue with the treatment above.  I note that her blood pressure dips at night 110/50 and 85/50 compared to a day peak of 156/90.  She clearly needs blood pressure medication but I wonder whether a drug like losartan in the morning (she was intolerant to ramipril) might reduce the risk of nocturnal dipping which may be making her glaucoma worse.  I am not, however, an expert in blood pressure medication and will leave this in your hands.   If you do change her medication, I would be very grateful if you could arrange to repeat her 24h BP and give the results to her to bring to us.  With many thanks
