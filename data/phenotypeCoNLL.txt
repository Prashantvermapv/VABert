Fundus O
Examination O
On O
fundus O
examination, O
the O
earliest O
manifestation O
is O
widespread O
pigment O
clumping O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
RPE, O
which O
is O
distinct O
from O
the O
characteristic O
perivascular O
bone-spicule O
pigment O
clumping O
seen O
in O
retinitis O
pigmentosa.[10] O
Subsequently, O
patients O
develop O
well-defined O
regions O
of O
atrophy O
with O
visible O
underlying O
sclera O
and O
large O
choroidal O
vessels, O
most O
commonly O
in O
the O
postequatorial O
region O
just O
outside O
the O
vascular O
arcades. O
These O
areas O
of O
atrophy O
advance O
centripetally O
and O
are O
also O
found O
in O
a O
peripapillary O
and O
parapapillary O
manner O
(See O

An O
island O

until O
later O
stages O
of O
the O
disease O
when O
central O
and O

become O

from O
foveal O

Patients O
have O
preserved O
larger O
choroidal O
blood O
vessels O
and O
normal O
appearing O
retinal O
vessels. O
In O
addition, O
choroideremia O
exhibits O
no O
optic O
atrophy, O
unlike O
the O
waxy O
pallor O
of O
optic O
discs O
seen O
in O

Carrier O
patients O
can O
have O
mild O
RPE O

and O
in O
severe O
cases, O
patchy O
RPE O
degeneration O
and O
areas O
of O
atrophy.[10][38] O
This O
phenotypic O
variability O
in O
carriers O
is O
due O
to O
lyonization O
in O
which O
one O
copy O
of O
the O

early O
in O

Other O

a O

Although O
